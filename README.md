## 1️⃣ Project Overview

### 📌 Project Title  
**ScreenMind: An AI-Based Mental Health Detection System for Smartphone Addiction**

### 🧩 Problem Domain, Research Purpose & Motivation

Excessive smartphone usage has become a significant contributor to **mental health challenges**, particularly among young adults. Prolonged screen time, late-night phone usage, reduced physical mobility, and unhealthy social media engagement are strongly associated with **stress, depression, sleep disorders, reduced psychological satisfaction, lowered energy levels, and social isolation**.

Despite the growing prevalence of these issues, most existing digital wellbeing and mental health solutions rely heavily on **self-reported data**, which is often subjective, inconsistent, delayed, and prone to user bias. This limits their effectiveness in detecting early mental health risks and providing timely support.

The primary purpose of this research is to **identify and predict the negative impacts of excessive smartphone usage on mental health** through a **passive, data-driven, and privacy-preserving approach**. By analyzing smartphone usage logs, mobility patterns, communication behavior, sensor data, and social media interaction patterns, the proposed AI-based system aims to:

- Detect early signs of smartphone addiction-related mental health risks  
- Predict potential mental health deterioration using machine learning and deep learning models  
- Support preventive interventions to improve users’ overall mental well-being and daily functioning  

A core focus of **ScreenMind** is **early intervention**. Rather than waiting for users to seek clinical or professional mental health support, ScreenMind functions as a **“Digital Guardian”** that continuously monitors behavioral patterns and identifies correlations between digital habits and mental well-being. This empowers users to recognize harmful usage trends early and take corrective action **before clinical intervention becomes necessary**.

## 🔬 Research Components & AI Models

The system is powered by four specialized research modules designed to detect early indicators of mental health challenges through passive sensing.

### 1️⃣ Mental Health Predictor (Screen Usage)

* **Focus:** Anxiety & Addiction detection.
* **Data Sources:** Total screen time, unlock frequency, session duration, and app category distribution.
* **AI Technique:** **Random Forest / Decision Trees** used to classify usage patterns into risk levels based on compulsive behavior markers.

### 2️⃣ Sleep Disruption Risk Estimation

* **Focus:** Circadian Rhythm Health & Sleep Quality.
* **Data Sources:** Ambient light sensors, accelerometer movement, screen-off timestamps, and late-night notification frequency.
* **AI Technique:** **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** networks to analyze time-series data and identify deviations from healthy sleep windows.

### 3️⃣ Social Isolation & Loneliness Detection

* **Focus:** Depression & Social Withdrawal.
* **Data Sources:** Mobility patterns (GPS radius/entropy), communication metadata (Call/SMS ratios), and behavioral regularity.
* **AI Technique:** **K-Means Clustering** to detect significant reductions in "Life Space" and shifts in social interaction frequency.

### 4️⃣ Social Media Interaction Analysis

* **Focus:** Mood & Emotional State monitoring.
* **Data Sources:** Scroll speed, typing cadence, session duration, and notification sentiment.
* **AI Technique:** **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** for sentiment analysis combined with **Behavioral Regression** models to map interaction speed to emotional volatility.
